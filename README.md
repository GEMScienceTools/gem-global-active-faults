# GEM Global Active Faults

The [GEM Foundation's][gem] Global Active Faults project (GEM-GAF) is building 
a comprehensive, global dataset of active fault traces of seismogenic concern. 
The dataset comprises GIS files hosted here of fault traces and small amount of 
relevant attributes or metadata (fault geometry, kinematics, slip rate, etc.) 
useful for seismic hazard modeling and other tectonic applications. The dataset 
is being assembled primarily as a part of GEM's global Probabilistic Seismic 
Hazard Modeling efforts, although we hope that the data find wide use in 
research, education and general interest among many users.

The dataset is freely and publicly available here, under a Creative Commons 
attribution license.

The dataset currently covers most of the deforming continental regions on 
earth, with exceptions of northeast Asia, the Malay Archipelago, Madagascar, 
Canada, and a few other regions. These are to be added progressively through 
2017.

The data is viewable in an interactive map [here][gaf-viewer].
